            <h1>The Psychology of Life Drawing:</h1>
                <h2><i>What I Learned I&rsquo;ve Been Doing Wrong and How I Fixed It</i></h2>
                    <h3>A Mental Triumph</h3>
                        <p>Creating a successful piece of artwork is a mental triumph, not a feat achieved solely by the hands. Sure, some degree of dexterity is necessary to complete a well-done drawing, but I would argue that the physical component of drawing comprises less than 15% of the process. A simple attitude adjustment about your own ability will do wonders for your artwork. It sounds cheesy, but an optimistic attitude about artistic self-improvement really will yield tangible results.</p>
                    <h3>Seeing</h3>
                        <p>Drawing begins with sight. In fact, seeing is the most important part to the drawing process. In my earlier years of sketching, I would find myself getting frustrated by a lack of true resemblance between the real life object I was attempting to draw and the sketch I had done in my sketchbook. It wasn&rsquo;t until high school that I realized what was hindering my ability to produce accurate images: I wasn&rsquo;t truly seeing my subject. Take a portrait for example. People are often tempted to jump into the sketching process of a portrait prematurely because their subject is something familiar. We know that our subject has a nose, two eyes and a mouth, and we know we will be drawing these body parts, so we spend less time seeing what we&rsquo;re drawing. We tend fall into autopilot and draw what we know, not what we see. It is not enough to arbitrarily draw out what we know an eye looks like, what we know a nose looks like, and what we know a mouth looks like. This technique will result in an inaccurate representation of our subject and a discouraged artist. Instead, it is infinitely more effective to focus on transferring the exact image that our eyes perceive from our brains to the paper. It is not enough to trust our knowledge of what a face looks like, or even what our subject specifically looks like; we must rely on our eyes and actively see our subject in order to replicate a precise image.</p>
                    <h3>It&rsquo;s All About Shapes</h3>
                        <p>In my opinion, shape is the most important element of art. It seems that artists focus too much on lines, and as a result, shapes don&rsquo;t get the recognition they deserve. Paying attention to the shapes created by both negative and positive spaces and highlights and shadows can make the difference between mediocre work and a masterpiece. Going back to my example of portraits, a large part of seeing your subject is being able to break down the image your eye is capturing into shapes. An eye isn&rsquo;t simply &quot;eye-shaped;&quot; it is made up of many tinier shapes that vary from eye to eye. Because the shapes in a face perceived by the eye differ from person to person and change depending on the viewer&rsquo;s perspective, it is critical that the artist takes note of the exact shape she sees rather than flipping autopilot on and drawing the shape she knows any eye to be made up of. It may feel unnatural to portray an eye or nose or mouth in the odd shapes youâ€™ve mentally broken your subject down to, but if you are true to your eye&rsquo;s perception and draw with honesty, you will be pleased with the final result.</p>
                <h3>Drawings Are 2-Dimensional</h3>
                    <p>No matter how much you would like your drawing to &quot;come to life&quot; and take on a third dimension, it will only ever be 2-dimensional. Even when drawing from life, your portrayal of 3-dimensional objects can only be done in two dimensions as long as you&rsquo;re working on the flat surface of paper. That being said, it is important to train your eye to see your subject as a 2-dimensional image in order to make the transition from the real life 3-dimensional object into a 2-dimensional drawing happen more smoothly. As someone who typically uses photographs as a reference when drawing, I used to struggle with drawing 3-dimensional objects from life. Once I began to treat real life objects the same way I treated photographs by taking a &quot;mental snapshot&quot; of my subject before me, I began to see the object the way I needed to. It wasn&rsquo;t until I mentally removed myself from my environment and started treating my view of my subject as a &quot;photo&quot; that I was able to produce a successful life drawing. The process of seeing your subject that I mentioned previously has two parts: mentally registering the object as a 2-dimensional image, then breaking down that 2-dimensional image into shapes the way I just explained. This is where many people, including myself, make a mistake. Rather than slowing down and trying to view their subject in the format that they will be drawing it in (two dimensions), they jump to the sketching step with a 3-D object still in mind. When you begin sketching with a 3-D object in mind, you can only break the object down into smaller 3-D shapes, and you end up with a difficult drawing task and a headache. By mentally flattening out what you are seeing before beginning to sketch, like observing a photograph, you will save yourself a lot of stress during the physical drawing process.</p>
                <h3>In A Nutshell</h3>
                    <p>Here is how I would sum up the steps of drawing:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Observe your subject.</li>
                            <li>Mentally flatten out your 3-dimensional subject into a 2-dimensional image or &quot;snapshot.&quot;</li>
                            <li>Break down that 2-dimensional image into shapes.</li>
                            <li>Draw these shapes, frequently checking your subject for accuracy.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </br>
                    <p>In addition, here are some rules of thumb to keep in mind during your drawing endeavors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep an optimistic mindset. This stuff is supposed to be fun! Enjoy the process, be proud of your progress, and use your mistakes as an opportunity to learn and grow.</li></br>
                            <li>Slow down; be patient with both the drawing process and yourself.</li></br>
                            <li>Break down the subject (and process) into pieces that are easy to digest.</li></br>
                            <li>Draw what you <i>see</i>, not what you know.</li></br>
                            <li>Don&rsquo;t get discouraged and don&rsquo;t lose sight of your goals; understand that improvement takes time but is a rewarding process if you invest time and effort. Everyone has to start somewhere, but the people who truly flourish are the ones that don&rsquo;t let themselves get caught up in their frustration and instead channel that energy towards their desire to improve the next time around.</li></br>
                            <li>Similarly, and like most things in life, however much you put into drawing is how much you&rsquo;ll get out of it. Fully immerse yourself in the process. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how fulfilling each step of the way can be if you only let it, and you will feel <i>so rewarded</i> when you look back at how far you&rsquo;ve come.</li></br>
                        </ul>
                    </br>
            <h1>Painting with Colored Pencil</h1>
                <p>I have always been envious of oil painters. The amount of realistic detail that a talented oil painter can achieve allows them to produce truly remarkable pieces. They can bring paint to life. I dabbled with oil paint a few times growing up but never could get the hang of it, yet the technique still intrigued me. Discouraged by my failed attempts at becoming a painter, I turned to colored pencil for the majority of my art projects in middle school, high school, and college. Looking to imitate the style of my oil painting friends, I developed a technique that allows me to create painting-like drawings with colored pencils.</p>
            <h3>Grids Aren't Cheating</h3>
                <p>Humans err; therefore we need grids. As someone who is interested in hyperrealism, I am a big advocate of using grids in order to be precise. When trying to replicate a photo, you want to be exact. To be exact, you must be in proportion. To be in proportion, you must use a grid system. The type of drawings I do call for a great amount of accuracy, otherwise my work won&rsquo;t be impressive or interesting. By calculating a grid system to use between your photo and the paper you will be drawing on, you can sketch out a proportionate skeleton of what your drawing will look like before getting started, guaranteeing an accurate depiction of your subject. Grids arenâ€™t cheating; they simply serve as a tool to increase accuracy.</p>
            <h3>All Squares Are Created Equal</h3>
                <p>Once you have drawn out your grid and sketched a foundation of your drawing, it&rsquo;s time to alter your perception of what you&rsquo;re about to draw. Rather than drawing one large picture, you are now drawing a bunch of tiny pictures. I&rsquo;ve learned that in order to reach the realistic level of detail that I strive to attain, I have to treat each square of my grid as its own miniature drawing. This way, I won&rsquo;t skim over important details that might not seem important when taking in the big picture. The more observant and meticulous you allow your eyes to be, the more lifelike your drawing will turn out. So, a grid serves not only as a tool for accurate proportions but additionally an instrument for dividing up your picture into smaller pieces that are easy to digest.
                </br>
                Focusing on smaller sections of the image will also prevent your brain from tricking your eyes. Sometimes isolating a feature in a photo, like an eye of a portrait, can make the feature look odd. This makes us want to change how the eye looks in our drawing to match what we think the eye should look like. When drawing familiar subjects, like portraits of friends, itâ€™s easy to ignore what we&rsquo;re actually seeing and turn to our knowledge of what a face looks like. Making your subject&rsquo;s eyes look more like what you know his eyes look like than what you&rsquo;re seeing in the picture will result in incongruity between the subject&rsquo;s appearance and your drawing. Focusing on the squares of the grid as individual drawings rather than focusing on the individual features will allow you to concentrate on the true shapes that make up the big picture and relieve the cognitive dissonance that occurs when a feature seems odd on its own. The key is to trust your eyes, not your logic.</p>
            <h3>Think Paint, Not Pencil</h3>
                <p>Like in painting, blending is key. When using wax-based pencils, like Prismacolor, it is possible to blend colors to create smooth transitions between hues or even create new hues. Blending colors eliminates flatness that can drain the life from a drawing. Applying more pressure when blending will create richer, more vibrant colors and will allow your drawing to look more lifelike. I recommend starting each square with light shading and adding more pressure with your final blending strokes. This way, if you make a mistake when sketching out the contents of a square, you have only created faint markings that can be easily blended away later. Additionally, it is usually best to use more neutral tones for your top blending layer to ensure the end result looks natural. I recommend white for light areas and greys for dark areas.</p>
            <h3>Black is the Enemy</h3>
                <p>I was assigned my first colored pencil assignment in middle school. The picture I was drawing from was a photo of a still life comprised of peppers on a purple cloth that I had taken for the occasion. The one rule I was given for my pepper drawing was not to use the color black. This seemed tricky because of the high contrast and dark shadows in the photo, but I found ways to create dark values without my black pencil by blending other dark, completmentary colors together. As my drawing developed, I realized that the use of color to substitute black in its absence gave the drawing much more life, adding depth and making it richer. As my teacher was trying to show me, black has a way of flattening out a drawing and flat, pure black is not a color we see very frequently. As <link href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">Ian Storm Taylor mentions in one of his essays</href>, even black objects are not truly seen as pure black due to light reflecting off of their surfaces. Using a blend of colors to create dark areas not only avoids the flatness of black, but it adds an additional vibrance to the drawing and creates a more accurate image of what the eye would see naturally. It&rsquo;s a win/win. In moderation, used only for the smallest and darkest shadows, black is sometimes a necessary tool. However, to make sure black wonâ€™t drain life from my drawing, I always blend in a hint of color and avoid shading large areas with black.</p>
            <h3>Dissecting Color</h3>
                <p>In addition to zooming in on each individual square of the grid, it is equally important to &quot;zoom in&quot; on colors as well. What do I mean by this? Take the sky for example. We know the sky is blue; there is even a colored pencil named &quot;sky blue.&quot; When drawing the sky, our instinct is to reach for that sky blue pencil and shade in the entire thing without much thought, but this would result in a flat, unrealistic sky with far too brilliant of a hue. The truth is, most pictures of the sky have hints of grey or green, or even yellow, red, or brown and have a base color much paler than the sky blue pencil. When we slip into autopilot while drawing, we fail to notice undertones that could make our drawing magnificent and instead wind up with a sky the color of a highly saturated Twitter bird. So to avoid this, we must &quot;zoom in&quot; on color, ignoring the big picture and focusing on smaller portions of color. By going square by square, we are less likely to be influenced by what color we know our subject is in reality and can then rely more on what colors we are actually seeing in the photo. This technique requires a great amount of visual honesty with yourself about the colors you are seeing; don&rsquo;t let previous knowledge of the color of your subject trick your eyes. For each shape you see in every square, run through the primary and secondary colors as well as grey, pink, chartreuse, and peach, asking yourself if any of these tones are even faintly present in that particular area. This will seem like a tedious routine at first, but in time you can train your eyes to dissect color and the process will become almost automatic. Blending hints of these undertones into base colors will make a dramatic difference in the quality of your work.</p>
            <h3>Saturation</h3>
                <p>In hindsight this is fairly intuitive, but in the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve concluded that in order to make a drawing visually appealing, you must work from a visually appealing photo. I&rsquo;ve found that the best way to increase a picture&rsquo;s aesthetic appeal in preparation for a drawing is to boost the saturation. By doing this, I was able to detect those minor undertones that make the colors of a drawing pop. For example, in one of my <i>self-portraits</i>, I began all flesh-toned squares of my grid by lightly shading in turquoise, pink, and yellow before going back over the area with neutral colors and greater pressure to blend it all together. Even for hair colors, like in <i>Drinkin&rsquo; Outta Cups</i>, I use blues and reds to make duller colors more vibrant.</p>
            <h3>In a Nutshell</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Be observant -- it is crucial to notice details and examine exact shapes made by negative and positive space, highlights, and shadows.</li>
                    <li>Be a conscious artist; don't turn on autopilot.</li>
                    <li>Me meticulous; it will be evident in the level of detail in your work.</li>
                    <li>Trust your <i>eyes</i>, not your brain, when determining color.</li>
                    <li>Work square to square, not feature to feature.</li>
                </ol>
